# Project Description
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A Codepen Clone built using **ReactJS**- front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components, **Material UI**- A CSS framework that provides React components out-of-the-box and follows Google's Material Design and **CodeMirror**- JavaScript component that provides a code editor in the browser.

It detects **Html**, **Css** and **Javascript** codes written on its collapsable and expandable editors and renders the output according to the code written on these editors.

On reloading the webpage the content of the editors remains saved on local storage and doesn't wipe out.
